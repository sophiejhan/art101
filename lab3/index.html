		<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
		<p>The subject of this lab was to create a local file structure on my computer, add index.html files, and upload it to the server.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>One difficulty I had was trying to adjust the width of my uploaded portrait. I had typed the code into my HTML file instead of the CSS file, but I was able to remember after seeing the code appear as text on my website instead of as a format change.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>This is my index.html file I created and this is the file structure I made:</p>
		<img src="img/lab3filestructure.png" width=1000px; />
		<p>This is a screenshot of Task 2 html source code and art101/index.html as it appeared in my browser:</p>
