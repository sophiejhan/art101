			<h2>Kazarina</h2>
			<p>My name is Kazarina, I'm a student at UCSC also a 3rd year majoring in F&DM. I'm from Taiwan and I have a younger brother. Taiwan is where boba was initiated and I'm very proud of that. I also have a bunny named Rocket, he's 2 years old now. I love going to the beach and love Mario games on Nintendo Switch. One fun fact about me is that I love anything with salted caramel flavor or coconut. I don't know what to say anymore.</p>
