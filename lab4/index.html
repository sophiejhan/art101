		<h1> Challenge </h1>
		<p> The challenge of this lab was trying to get into the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before we jump into coding. </p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h1> Problems </h1>
		<p> We didn't run into any big problems this lab.</p>
	</div>

		<p>These lists describe the pseudocode steps in a computer task for a checkers game:</p>
		<pre><code>
				Creating a checkers game:
				1. Print game board before each turn.
				2. Invite two players.
				3. Accept player 1 input.
				4. Validate player input.
				5. Accept player 2 input.
				6. Validate player 2 input.
				7. Test win or draw condition.
