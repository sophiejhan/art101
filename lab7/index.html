        <h1>Lab 7 Functions</h1>
        <p>Working with a partner to write functions that take user input.</p>
        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>We did not really have any big issues that prevented our code from working. We just looked over our code to make sure everything was formatted correctly.</p>
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>Some problems we had were not linking our JavaScript file to our HTML correctly because we didn't specify the lab7 file. We also forgot the parenthesis when declaring the funciton.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>This index.html is the result. Here is the program execution:</p>
        <div>
            <h2>Script Output</h2>
            <script src="js/lab7.js"></script>
        </div>
