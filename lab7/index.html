        <h1>Lab 7 Functions</h1>
        <p>Working with a partner to write functions that take user input.</p>
        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>We had to figure out how to declare arrays and also objects in JavaScript!</p>
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>A problem we had was the script not outputting. We kept referencing our code to the lab instructions and found out we forgot a closed curly bracket when declaring the object.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>This index.html is the result. Here is the program execution:</p>
        <div>
            <h2>Script Output</h2>
            <script src="js/lab7.js"></script>
        </div>
