        <h1>Lab 8 Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
        <p>Working with a partner to experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>We did not really have any big issues that prevented our code from working. We just looked over our code to make sure everything was formatted correctly.</p>
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>Some problems we had were not following the lab instructions super closely which led to some confusion on our part. We were able to get our code working eventually by changing small typos.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>This index.html is the result. Here is the program execution:</p>
